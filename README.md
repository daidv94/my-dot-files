# Collection of my dot files for all my laptops.

I love working in terminal, I'm using vim everyday, currently all my working flows are on terminal.
My `dotfiles` are managed by this repository with the wonderful help of [stow](https://github.com/aspiers/stow)

## List

- [zshrc](./zsh/)
- [wezterm](./wezterm/)
- [tmux](./tmux/)
- [yazi](./yazi/)
- [neovim](./nvim/)

## Dependencies

- Need to use terminal emulator like `wezterm` or `iterm2`... to display theme correctly and even the image background
- Use `Nerfont` for icon, text, folder,... I'm using `JetBrains Mono Nerd Font
- `ripgrep` installed
